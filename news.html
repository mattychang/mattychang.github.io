                <p>Maya, an undergrad in the Gryder lab, presented her research at Intersections! She shared preliminary findings about the effect IHK-44, a novel dual CBP/p300 inhibitor, has on cell proliferation in FP-RMS, FN-RMS, and non-malignant myoblasts cell lines. Future directions aim to profile IHK-44 through the Broad Institute's PRISM screen as part of the DepMap project and assess IHK-44's mechanism of cell death. </p>

                <p>I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with my bachelor's in Chemistry and minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. I’m deeply grateful to the mentors who guided me, the collaborators who challenged me, and the friends who supported me throughout this journey. Special thanks to Berkley Gryder, Matthew Bertin, Fu-Sen Liang, and Chris Butler. Looking ahead, I’ll remain in Cleveland to work as a research assistant in the Gryder lab while applying to PhD programs in genetics or cancer biology. Excited for what’s next!</p>
