                <h1>Research Summary</h1>
                <p>I conducted my first research project alongside Sarah Kohrt, formerly a PhD candidate and now a postdoc at UNC Chapel Hill, whose thesis focused on characterizing an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (BG-15a). My specific project focused on investigating the localization of the AR after treatment with BG-15a. Using biotinylated-isoxazole (b-isox), a compound that binds to the intrinsically disordered regions of the AR and precipitates out at high concentrations, I showed through Western blots that the AR is insoluble at higher concentrations of b-isox after treatment with BG-15a. Coupled with previous findings, I validated that the AR localizes into the nucleus but represses cell proliferation and gene expression after BG-15a drug treatment, suggesting a new mechanism of action in which the AR binds to chromatin but does not activate transcription. This project led to one publication in PNAS.</p>
                <p>More recently, I've been working with Imdadul Khan, a postdoc, to characterize a novel and potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-44) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), a rare pediatric cancer driven by a fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F). After the recent discovery that P3F recruits the histone acetyltrafersases CBP/p300 to its C-terminal activation domain by a cysteine reside, C793, we showed that IHK-44 reduces histone acetylation, selectively downregulates P3F target genes, and slows down aRMS proliferation. Furthermore, we discovered that IHK-44, along with other CBP/p300 epigenetic small molecules are more sensitive in aRMS than in embryonal RMS (eRMS) and non-cancerous myoblast cell lines. This led us to believe that there may be greater dependency on CBP/p300 and deposits of histone acetylation in aRMS than in eRMS. By looking at baseline histone acetylation levels, we showed that H2B N-terminus acetylation (H2BNTac) may serve as a biomarker for enhancer-addicted cancers, like MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and AR+ prostate cancer. This vulnerability may serve as a predictor of cancer cell vulnerability to CBP/p300 inhibition in the clinic. We've submitted this work to Molecular Cell where it is currently in review.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am piloting a new project aimed at directly targeting the essential cysteine residue in the C-terminal domain of P3F. A purely biochemical approach was not pursued, as purification of P3F is hindered by its intrinsically disordered nature. To circumvent these challenges, I implemented a luciferase reporter assay paired with a counter-screen to evaluate a cysteine-focused covalent library. This effort yielded 376 compounds capable of disrupting P3F-driven transcription. Building on these results, I established a hit-to-lead pipeline incorporating orthogonal assays: cell viability assays to assess cytotoxicity and potency, cellular thermal shift assays to confirm direct target engagement, competitive activity-based protein profiling to evaluate proteome-wide selectivity, and fluorescence-based monitoring of endogenously tagged P3F to track protein stability and degradation, and purification of that cell line by IP-MS to map peptide-wide selectivity. More work is necessary to establish the binding and covalency mechanisms of the lead, as well as assessing the phenotypic effects and translational potential of the lead.</p>
