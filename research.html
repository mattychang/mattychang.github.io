                <h1>Research Summary</h1>
                <p>I conducted my first research project alongside Sarah Kohrt, formerly a PhD candidate and now a postdoc at UNC Chapel Hill, whose thesis focused on characterizing an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (BG-15a). My specific project focused on investigating the localization of the AR after treatment with BG-15a. Using biotinylated-isoxazole (b-isox), a compound that binds to the intrinsically disordered regions of the AR and precipitates out at high concentrations, I showed through Western blots that the AR is insoluble at higher concentrations of b-isox after treatment with BG-15a. Coupled with previous findings, I validated that the AR localizes into the nucleus but represses cell proliferation and gene expression after BG-15a drug treatment, suggesting a new mechanism of action in which the AR binds to chromatin but does not activate transcription. </p>
                <p>More recently, I've been working with Imdadul Khan, a postdoc, to characterize a new and potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-44) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), a rare pediatric cancer driven by enhancer-bound transcriptional programs. After the recent discovery that PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) recruits the histone acetyltrafersases CBP/p300 to its activation domain, we showed that IHK-44 reduces histone acetylation, selectively downregulates P3F target genes, and slows down aRMS proliferation. Furthermore, we discovered that IHK-44, along with other CBP/p300 epigenetic small molecules are more sensitive in aRMS than in embryonal RMS (eRMS) and non-cancerous myoblast cell lines. This led us to believe that there may be greater dependency on CBP/p300 and deposits of histone acetylation in aRMS than in eRMS. By looking at basal histone acetylation levels, we showed that H2B N-terminus acetylation (H2BNTac) may serve as a biomarker for enhancer-addicted cancers, like aRMS and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. This sensitivity may serve as a strong predictor of cancer cell vulnerability to CBP/p300 inhibition. </p>
                <h1>Research Interests</h1>
                <h2>3D nuclear organization and gene regulation</h2>
                <p>The genome is not a flat string of DNA but a folded, compartmentalized, and highly dynamic structure. Chromosomes occupy distinct territories, enhancers loop across vast distances to meet their promoters, and nuclear compartments act as hubs for either activating or silencing genes. These layers of 3D organization work together to control cell identity and ensure precise responses to environmental signals. When these principles are disrupted — by fusion oncogenes, enhancer hijacking, or chromatin misfolding — the consequences are profound, often driving developmental disorders and cancer. Understanding nuclear architecture offers not only fundamental insight but also new therapeutic strategies that target the “wiring” of the genome itself.</p>
                <h2>High-throughput screening targeting transcription in cancer</h2>
                <p>Transcription factors and co-factors sit at the heart of gene regulation, but their structural flexibility and lack of deep binding pockets have made them notoriously difficult to drug. Recent advances in high-throughput platforms are changing this landscape. Small-molecule libraries, CRISPR-based genetic perturbations, and readouts like reporter assays and sequencing technologies make it possible to systematically identify compounds that rewire transcription. Screening efforts can reveal both direct binders of transcriptional regulators and molecules that indirectly disrupt co-factor complexes, enhancer activity, or chromatin modifications. These approaches not only expand the toolkit for probing transcriptional biology but also pave the way for therapies targeting proteins once considered “undruggable.”</p>
                <h2>Phase separation and nuclear condensates</h2>
                <p>Within the crowded nucleus, many transcriptional regulators and chromatin-modifying enzymes do not act in isolation but cluster into membraneless condensates. These biomolecular assemblies, formed through phase separation, concentrate factors at enhancers and super-enhancers, boosting transcriptional efficiency and precision. Condensates emerge from two modes of molecular recognition: DNA sequence binding by transcription factors and recognition of histone modifications by reader domains. Disruption of these “liquid” compartments — by mutation, altered post-translational modifications, or small-molecule intervention — can reprogram transcriptional output and reshape cellular identity. Studying condensates sheds light on how cells organize complex tasks within nuclear space and how their misregulation contributes to disease.</p>
