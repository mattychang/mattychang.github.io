                <h1>Research Summary</h1>
                <p>I conducted my first research project alongside Sarah Kohrt, formerly a PhD candidate and now a postdoc at UNC Chapel Hill, whose thesis focused on characterizing an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (BG-15a). My specific project focused on investigating the localization of the AR after treatment with BG-15a. Using biotinylated-isoxazole (b-isox), a compound that binds to the intrinsically disordered regions of the AR and precipitates out at high concentrations, I showed through Western blots that the AR is insoluble at higher concentrations of b-isox after treatment with BG-15a. Coupled with previous findings, I validated that the AR localizes into the nucleus but represses cell proliferation and gene expression after BG-15a drug treatment, suggesting a new mechanism of action in which the AR binds to chromatin but does not activate transcription. </p>
                <p>More recently, I've been working with Imdadul Khan, a postdoc, to characterize a new and potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-44) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS), a rare pediatric cancer driven by enhancer-bound transcriptional programs. After the recent discovery that PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) recruits the histone acetyltrafersases CBP/p300 to its activation domain, we showed that IHK-44 reduces histone acetylation, selectively downregulates P3F target genes, and slows down aRMS proliferation. Furthermore, we discovered that IHK-44, along with other CBP/p300 epigenetic small molecules are more sensitive in aRMS than in embryonal RMS (eRMS) and non-cancerous myoblast cell lines. This led us to believe that there may be greater dependency on CBP/p300 and deposits of histone acetylation in aRMS than in eRMS. By looking at basal histone acetylation levels, we showed that H2B N-terminus acetylation (H2BNTac) may serve as a biomarker for enhancer-addicted cancers, like aRMS and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. This sensitivity may serve as a strong predictor of cancer cell vulnerability to CBP/p300 inhibition. </p>
                <!-- <p>I'm also working alongside Diana Chin, a PhD candidate, investigating the RUNX2 subtype in osteosarcoma (OS). Previous work have shown that RUNX2 promotes and maintains an osteoblast-like transcriptional and epigenetic state in OS by coordinating chromatin architecture. To show the dependence of RUNX2 in OS, I've generated doxycycline-inducible shRNA RUNX2 knockdown OS cell lines using lentiviral constructs. I validated these cell lines by qPCR, RNA-seq, and Western blot. </p> -->
