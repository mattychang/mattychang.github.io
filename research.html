                <h1>Research Summary</h1>
                <p>I conducted my first research project alongside Sarah Kohrt, a PhD candidate, whose thesis focused on characterizing an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (BG-15a). My specific project focused on investigating the localization of the AR after treatment with BG-15a. Using biotinylated-isoxazole (b-isox), a compound that binds to the intrinsically disordered regions of the AR and precipitates out at high concentrations, I showed through Western blots that the AR is insoluble at higher concentrations of b-isox after treatment with BG-15a. Coupled with previous findings, I validated that the AR localizes into the nucleus but represses cell proliferation and gene expression after BG-15a drug treatment, suggesting a new mechanism of action in which the AR binds to chromatin but does not activate transcription. </p>
                <p>More recently, I've been working with Imdadul Khan, a postdoc, to characterize a new and potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-45) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS). After the recent discovery that PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) recruits the histone acetyltrafersases CBP/p300 to its activation domain, we showed that IHK-45 reduces histone acetylation through Western blots and ChIP-seq, selectively downregulates P3F target genes using RNA-seq, and slows down aRMS cell proliferation. Furthermore, we discovered that H2B N-terminus acetylation (H2BNTac) may be a biomarker for enhancer-addicted cancers, like aRMS and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. This discovery may serve as a strong predictor of cancer cell vulnerability to CBP/p300 inhibition. </p>
