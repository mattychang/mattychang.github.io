                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a graduating senior at Case Western Reserve University majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science. I currently work in <a href="https://gryderlab.com/" target="_blank">Berkley Gryder's lab</a> in the fields of chemical epigenomics and cancer biology. I'm particularly interested in leveraging insights from molecular and genomic techniques to identify targetable vulnerabilities and developing new chemical tools and screens to improve treatment. I'm currently applying to PhD programs.</p>
                <p>As a trainee in the Cancer-focused Summer Undergraduate Research (CanSUR) program, I utilized solubility differences to show that the androgen receptor (AR) localizes to the nucleus but fails to promote gene expression after treatment with a novel AR antagonist (BG-15a) in prostate cancer. My focus shifted to fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, where I explored the transcriptional dependencies of the PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) fusion oncoprotein after treatment with a potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-44). Using RNA-seq, I showed that IHK-44 and other dual inhibitors and degraders of CBP/p300 were better at downregulating P3F target genes than selective degraders of CBP/p300. Furthermore, I showed that RNA Pol2 function and histone acetylation levels decreased in samples treated at longer time-points with IHK-44 using ChIP-seq. I discovered that cancers with high levels of H2B acetylation were characterized with high enhancer activity, suggesting that H2B is a biomarker for enhancer addicted cancers. This work opened my eyes to both the translational opportunity that chemical probes possess, as well as the power of next-generation sequencing in uncovering further insights. In the future, I hope to continue taking a chemical and bioinformatic approach to solve biological problems.</p>
                <p>Outside of the lab, you can find me at the climbing gym or at the pool. I swam competitively for over ten years in my youth, breaking a few individual and relay state records. I was introduced to climbing by my roommate during my freshmen year of college. I climbed a few times at the Red River Gorge in Kentucky and at the New River Gorge in West Virginia a few times, although I mostly stick to the indoors now. Recently, I've picked up digital art on the side though I'm not very good at it yet.</p>
