                <img src="images/selfie.JPG" alt="Matthew S. Chang" class="profile-pic">
                <p>I am a research assistant at Case Western Reserve University in <a href="https://gryderlab.com/" target="_blank">Berkley Gryder's lab</a>. I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with my bachelor's in chemistry and minors in mathematics and computer science in the spring of 2025. I have expertise in chemical biology, cancer biology, and epigenetics. I'm interested in leveraging insights from molecular and genomic techniques to identify targetable vulnerabilities and developing new tools to improve patient outcomes. I am currently applying to PhD programs.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, and as a trainee in the Cancer-focused Summer Undergraduate Research (CanSUR) program, I utilized solubility differences to show that the androgen receptor (AR) localizes to the nucleus but fails to promote gene expression after treatment with a novel AR antagonist (BG-15a) in prostate cancer. My contribution resulted in a co-author publication in PNAS. My focus shifted to fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, where I explored the functional dependencies of the PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) fusion transcription factor after treatment with a new, potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-44). Using RNA-seq, I showed that IHK-44 and other dual inhibitors and degraders of CBP/p300 were better at downregulating P3F target genes than selective degraders of CBP/p300. Furthermore, I showed that RNA Pol II function and H2BK16ac levels decreased in samples treated at longer time-points with IHK-44 using ChIP-seq. We also showed that cancers with high levels of H2B acetylation (H2Bac) were characterized with greater enhancer activity, suggesting that H2Bac can act as a biomarker for "enhancer-addicted" cancers. My contributions to this project will result in a co-first-author publication later this year. </p>
                <p>Outside of the lab, you can find me at the climbing gym or at the pool. Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, I swam competitively for over ten years, breaking a few individual and relay state records. Coming to college, I was introduced to climbing, and since then I've been to the Red River Gorge in Kentucky and the New River Gorge in West Virginia. Recently, I've picked up digital art on the side and I'm excited to share my portfolio soon!</p>
