                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img src="images/selfie.JPG" alt="Matthew S. Chang" class="profile-pic">
                <p>I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Case Western Reserve University as part of the BSTP program. I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with my bachelor's in chemistry and minors in mathematics and computer science. I worked in <a href="https://gryderlab.com/" target="_blank">Berkley Gryder's lab</a> in the fields of chemical epigenomics, cancer biology, and drug discovery. I'm interested in leveraging insights from molecular and genomic techniques to identify targetable vulnerabilities and developing new tools to improve patient outcomes. </p>
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, and as a trainee in the Cancer-focused Summer Undergraduate Research (CanSUR) program, I utilized solubility differences to show that the androgen receptor (AR) localizes to the nucleus but fails to promote gene expression after treatment with a novel AR antagonist (BG-15a) in prostate cancer. My focus shifted to fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, where I explored the functional dependencies of the PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) fusion oncoprotein after treatment with a new, potent CBP/p300 inhibitor (IHK-44). Using Western blots, I showed that IHK-44 reduces histone acetylation at longer time-points and higher dosages. Using RNA-seq, I showed that IHK-44 and other dual inhibitors and degraders of CBP/p300 were better at downregulating P3F target genes than selective degraders of CBP/p300. Furthermore, I showed that RNA Pol II function and histone acetylation levels decreased in samples treated at longer time-points with IHK-44 using ChIP-seq. I also discovered that cancers with high levels of H2B acetylation were characterized with high enhancer activity, suggesting that H2B can act as a biomarker for enhancer addicted cancers. This work opened my eyes to both the translational opportunity that chemical probes possess, as well as the power of next-generation sequencing in uncovering further insights. In the future, I hope to combine bioinformatics and chemistry to solve biological problems.</p>
                <p>Outside of the lab, you can find me at the climbing gym or at the pool. Originally from Honolulu, Hawaii, I swam competitively for over ten years, breaking a few individual and relay state records. Coming to college, I was introduced to climbing, and since then I've been to the Red River Gorge in Kentucky and the New River Gorge in West Virginia. However, nowadays, I stick to indoor climbing. Recently, I've picked up digital art on the side, but I'm not very good at it yet.</p>
